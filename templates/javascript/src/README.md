## Quick Overview

```sh
npx create-gatsby-web
cd <your-project-name>
npm run develop/ yarn develop
```
If you've previously installed `create-gatsby-web` globally via `npm install -g create-gatsby-web`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-gatsby-web` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._<br>
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build/ yarn build`.

<!-- to do add gif how to use -->

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools.<br>
They are preconfigured so that you can focus on the code. However, all configuration files are exposed so you can customize them whenever you need.

Create a project, and you’re good to go!

### CI/CD pipeline support out-of-the-box

You **just** need to sign up for services, get access tokens and connect your services and the rest is handle my create-gatsby-web<br>
Integrated with scripts to provide real **develop-staging-production** experience.

Learn more [here](#user-guide)

### CMS support

Pre built webhooks support for CMS, you can configure your CMS to call to CircleCI webhooks. CircleCI is already pre configured run CI/CD job if being call by this webhook.<br>
No more broken deployment if client makes a mistake!

## Creating a Gatsby Web

**You’ll need to have Node 10 or later version on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new web, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-gatsby-web
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

It will generate the the initial project structure inside the current folder.<br>

All configurations are exposed and predefined folder structures, just write codes, no need to config<br>
Once the installation is done, you can start develop right away!

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm run develop` or `yarn develop`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `public` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed.

### `npm run storybook` or `yarn storybook`

Runs storybook in development mode.<br>
Storybook live at `http://localhost:6006`!

### Setup CI CD
**Video tutorial**
In-progress

**Prerequisites**
- Github/CircleCI/Netlify account, we only need free version!
- Github [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for CircleCI reporting deployment to Pull Request and Github Deployment, note down the token as ```GITHUB_DEPLOYMENTS_TOKEN=<the-token>```.
- Netlify **development** [personal access token](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications?&_ga=2.114107908.208815282.1582632982-167014225.1582120451#personal-access-tokens) for CircleCI to deploy preview and staging (this one belongs to Dev team Netlify's account). Note down the token as ```NETLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=<the-token>```. This is your staging website.
- Netlify **production** [personal access token](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications?&_ga=2.114107908.208815282.1582632982-167014225.1582120451#personal-access-tokens) for CircleCI to deploy production (this one belongs to Client Netlify's account - if you owned the project then development access token is enough). Note down the token as ```NETLIFY_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<the-token>```. This is your production website.


**How to**
- Upload project to Github's repo, if you want to use CircleCI for free, Github's repo must be **public**.
- Run ```yarn build/ npm run build```, you will get Gatsby built **public** folder in the root directory.
- Run ```yarn build-storybook/ npm run build-storybook```, you will get Storybook built **build-storybook** folder in the root directory.
- Login to **Dev team** Netlify, upload the **public** folder via the image below **(DO NOT USE new site from GIT)**, after upload you should get new project deployment in Netlify, click on it and go to site settings, note down the API ID as ```NETLIFY_SITE_ID_STAGING=<the-API-ID >```.
- Still in **Dev team** Netlify, upload the **build-storybook** folder via the image below **(DO NOT USE new site from GIT)**, after upload you should get storybook deployment in Netlify, click on it and go to site settings, note down the API ID as ```NETLIFY_SITE_ID_STORYBOOK=<the-API-ID >```.
- Login to **Client** Netlify, upload the **public** folder via the image below **(DO NOT USE new site from GIT)**, after upload you should get new project deployment in Netlify, click on it and go to site settings, note down the API ID as ```NETLIFY_SITE_ID_RELEASE=<the-API-ID >```.

- Voila! Pat your back because you have done a great job 👏

### Setup CMS webhook
**Video tutorial**
In-progress

**Prerequisites**
- CircleCI [personal access token](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/) for CMS to call CircleCi webhooks. Note down the token as ```CIRCLE-TOKEN=<the-token>```.
- CMS account, recommended [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- Connection keys from CMS, if you use Contentful, click on settings -> API keys -> Content delivery/preview tokens -> Add API key. Note down as: 

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<the-Space-ID>
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<the-Content-Delivery-API-access token>
```

**How to** (example with Contentful - similar to other CMS)

1. **Setup Contentful**
- Create a **.env** in project root directory, put this in the .env file:
```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<the-Space-ID>
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<the-Content-Delivery-API-access token>
```
- Run ```yarn add gatsby-source-contentful / npm install --save gatsby-source-contentful```
- Navigate to **gatsby-config**, uncomment the block of code:
```
/***** REMOVE COMMENT TO ENABLE CONTENTFUL CMS
{
	resolve: `gatsby-source-contentful`,
		options: {
			spaceId: process.env.CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID,
			accessToken: process.env.CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN,
		},
	},
******/
```
- Login to CircleCI, main dashboard -> jobs -> click on the setting of your project -> environment variable -> add variable. Then add your CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID and CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN.

2. **Setup webhook**

__Webhook for staging website__
- Login to Contentful, settings -> webhooks -> add webhooks
- Details -> name ```Trigger CircleCi Build Develop Branch```
- Details -> URL -> POST -> ```https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/github/<org-name-or-your-account-name>/<repo-name>/pipeline```
- Triggers -> Select specific triggering events -> tick all Publish + Unpublish
- Headers -> add custom header -> Name: ```Circle-Token``` -> Value: ```<the-token-value>```
- Content type -> application/json
- Payload -> Customize the webhook payload:
```
{
  "branch": "develop",
  "parameters": {
    "trigger": false,
    "cms-develop": true
  }
}
```
- Click save, voila! you got the **staging** webhook setup. Everytime there is change in contentful, the webhook will trigger CircleCI to run the pipeline and deploy the new content.

__Webhook for production website__
- Login to Contentful, settings -> webhooks -> add webhooks
- Details -> name ```Trigger CircleCi Build Master Branch```
- Details -> URL -> POST -> ```https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/github/<org-name-or-your-account-name>/<repo-name>/pipeline```
- Triggers -> Select specific triggering events -> tick all Publish + Unpublish
- Headers -> add custom header -> Name: ```Circle-Token``` -> Value: ```<the-token-value>```
- Content type -> application/json
- Payload -> Customize the webhook payload:
```
{
  "branch": "master",
  "parameters": {
    "trigger": false,
    "cms-master": true
  }
}
```
- Click save, voila! you got the **production** webhook setup. Everytime there is change in contentful, the webhook will trigger CircleCI to run the pipeline and deploy the new content.


## Philosophy

- **All exposed:** All configurations are exposed. You have total control of your project settings.

- **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds are handled for you, so you can focus on writing code.

- **CI/CD pipeline ready:** You can setup your own CI/CD pipeline with just a few steps.

- **CMS support** Pre built webhooks support made CMS integration easy.

## What’s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern Gatsby web:

- 🏎 React, Gatsby, JSX, ES6, TypeScript syntax support.
- 🏆 CI/CD ready with CircleCI and Netlify.
- 🤝 Out-of-the-box webhooks support for CMS.
- 💻 Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- 👌 Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.
- 💎 Rich utilities with Eslint, Prettier, Husky and Lint-staged built-in.
- 🛡 A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- ✅ A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- 🕵️‍♂️ A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.

The tradeoff is that **these are a lot of configuration files**. But they are all pre-configured and we have a detail explaination [here](#template-structure)
